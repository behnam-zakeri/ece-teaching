Scope
^^^^^

The course offers a general overview on drivers and impacts of global energy transitions.
Governing principles of international energy markets are reviewed briefly.
Enablers and barriers of global energy transitions are discussed, including
technological innovations, socio-behavioral aspects, and economic/political perspectives.
Some contemporary topics in global energy transitions, such as, energy access and poverty,
and energy and digitalization are discussed too. International environmental and climate agreements
are reviewed, with a practical view on monitoring and implementation. The course is multi-disciplinary,
suitable for students with different backgrounds, including but not limited to engineering, science, economics, and politics.
